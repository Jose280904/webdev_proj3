    <h2>Mexico</h2>
    <p>The first place I'd like to show is Mexico. The picture below is from Mexico City from when I visited it two winters ago. My family is from a city in Michoac√°n called Zamora, which has many historical figures.</p>

    <h2>Canada</h2>
    <p>The next place I have been to is Canada, which I visit quite often since I have family that lives up there. In the following picture, you can see a rodeo I attended the last time I was in Canada.</p>

    <h2>Bahamas</h2>
    <p>I have had the chance to go to the Bahamas twice now, and both times were amazing because it truly feels like paradise. I would highly recommend making that trip to the Bahamas to anyone. This is a picture from the last time I was out there.</p>
