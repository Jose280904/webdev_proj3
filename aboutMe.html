  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Where I Grew Up</h2>
    <p>I was born and raised on the southwest side of Chicago, mostly in the Back of the Yards, but I recently moved to the West Lawn area. I have always grown up around the Orange Line, which is shown in the following image.</p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I have a strong passion for cars, which is why I'm currently working as an auto technician at Best Buy, installing various car electronics. I’ve had the chance to work on my own car by upgrading a few things every now and then, as shown in the picture below.</p>

    <p>I also enjoy listening to music throughout the day because it helps me stay productive, whether it's for homework, work, or anything else. My current favorite artist is Junior H, a Mexican Regional artist from Hermosillo. You can listen to one of his older but my favorite songs in the video below.</p>

    <h2>Traveling</h2>
    <p>I also enjoy traveling. Although I haven’t been to too many places, I’ve visited Mexico, Canada, and the Bahamas, which I’ll go into more detail about in another section!</p>
